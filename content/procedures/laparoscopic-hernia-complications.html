                        <p><strong>Bleeding and infection</strong> rates are very low. Occasionally there can be
                            bruising in
                            the inguinal region.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Recurrence</strong> rates for the Laparoscopic inguinal hernia is approximately 1%,
                            this is
                            similar to the traditional Open inguinal hernia repair.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Conversion</strong> to an Open Inguinal hernia (i.e. larger scar) repair occurs in
                            less than
                            1%.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Post operative chronic pain</strong> is less with laparoscopic inguinal hernia
                            repair. This
                            is due to the position of the mesh away from the nerves, and thus less direct irritation
                            of the nerves. Chronic pain can occur following the laparoscopic inguinal hernia
                            repair. This is thought to be due to on-going nerve stimulation or preoperative tears
                            in the surrounding ligaments. Tacking devices are no longer used in the laparoscopic
                            repair.

                        <h3>Mesh controversy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Recently there has been some discussion into the validity of mesh. This was due to
                            the use of mesh in repair of the pelvic floor (not inguinal hernias). Mesh placed
                            incorrectly can cause problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mesh is indicated in inguinal hernia repairs and has been used successfully for over
                            30 years. The NZ General Surgical Association recently released a statement
                            affirming the above.

                        <h3>New Zealand Association General Surgeons position statement Mesh hernia repair</h3>

                        <p>
                            There has been much controversy in the media recently regarding transvaginal mesh
                            prolapse repair and its potential associated risks of infection, erosion and chronic
                            pain.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unfortunately, the media have portrayed the outcomes of this one
                                gynaecological procedure to include all surgical use of mesh for hernia
                                repair. It has caused unnecessary widespread patient stress and anxiety
                                throughout New Zealand. The use of mesh in General Surgery to repair
                                hernias of the groin or the abdominal wall is well established
                                internationally and is considered the procedure of choice.</li>
                            <li>For ventral hernias with fascial defects greater than 2cm in diameter
                                mesh must be used to reinforce the tissue repair.</li>
                            <li>If not the hernia recurrence rate without mesh is unacceptably high. For
                                groin hernia repair most surgeons worldwide use mesh for the repair. The
                                use of mesh for abdominal and groin hernia repair is safe. Chronic pain
                                may occur after hernia repair in less than 10% of patients. However, it is
                                important to remember that chronic pain after groin hernia repair is higher
                                for patients having non-mesh repair compared to mesh repair.</li>
                            <li>Mesh infection after abdominal hernia repair is uncommon, less than 1 %.</li>
                            <li>For laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair it is even lower.
                                The use of surgical mesh is an important part of the curriculum for general surgical
                                training and NZ general surgeons have extensive experience in the use of mesh for
                                hernia repair. </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            The good results of mesh hernia repair in general surgery should not be bought into
                            disrepute by categorising all mesh repairs as the same.
