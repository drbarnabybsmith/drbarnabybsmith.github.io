                        <p>You will be given pain relief to go home with. The water-proof dressings can be removed after
                            4 days. The Steri-strips beneath these can be left until they start to come away (usually 7
                            days). The scars will be closed with a dissolving suture.</p>

                        <p>Driving is to be avoided until you can perform the emergency brake without hesitation
                            (usually 3-4 days).</p>

                        <p>No heavy lifting 2 weeks. Heavy lifting is anything that requires two hands to lift (usually
                            greater than 5kg)</p>

                        <p>Return to work will be variable, but at least one week. Please ask for an off work
                            certificate if needed.</p>

                        <p>You will be seen in clinic in 2 weeks post surgery</p>
