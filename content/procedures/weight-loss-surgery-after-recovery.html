                        <h2>After Recovery</h2>

                        <p>After surgery, your weight will continue to decrease and soon you will have
                            recovered physically from the surgery. It is then that the success of the surgery
                            equally depends upon you as much as the surgery. It will require a lifetime of lifestyle
                            and nutritional changes for best and sustained results. Problems (like weight gain)
                            can occur after, but should not be inevitable. There are a few tips that when followed
                            can help you cope with the changes to your stomach after surgery</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stop eating if you feel full. Listen to your body. Understanding fullness, and
                                responding to this will avoid bloating, vomiting and Dumping syndrome. It is
                                best to stop eating once 'satiety' (fullness) is felt. Wait 5-10 mins and consider
                                continuing to eat.</li>
                            <li>Chewing your meals is best. Count 20 chews per mouthful. Each mouthful
                                should only be a teaspoon in size. This does slow your eating down, but as
                                you will be having small portions than before, mealtime should be the same
                                as your family / friends</li>
                            <li>Avoid drinking fluids 30 minutes before or after your meal. This will contribute
                                to bloating and nausea</li>
                            <li>Eating on the run, or in stressful environments have been shown to lead to
                                bad habits. Set time aside to eat properly.</li>
                            <li>Protein should be the main source of calories in your diet. Your Dietician will
                                explain sources of them. Calories just from carbohydrates will not provide
                                your body with sufficient building blocks for cell growth and repair. Always eat
                                your protein first in you meals. Consider freezing meals each week into
                                appropriate sized portions.</li>
                            <li>Continue to take your multivitamins and other vitamins recommended life
                                long. Your body will not be as efficient in absorbing these from your diet as
                                before surgery. Without these supplements you can experience anaemia
                                and/or thinning of your bones.</li>
                            <li>Continue to eat 'the right' choices as outlined by your Dietician and Surgeon.
                                Avoid casual snacking on high sugar snacks.</li>
                            <li>Constipation can be an ongoing issue. This is mostly due to insufficient fluid
                                intake (aim &gt;1500ml/day) or lack of fibre. Carrying and regularly sipping on a
                                drink bottle with water or fruit tea can assist with fluid. maintenance.
                                Increasing dietary fibre can be hard. Laxatives such as Phloe, Kiwicrush,
                                Psylium husks or laxsol are generally tolerated well. It is best to avoid
                                Lactulose</li>
                            <li>Exercise is regular part of your new life. It is important to do 30-45mins of
                                strenuous exercise at least 5 times a week. Fast walking is acceptable, but it
                                may be an idea to engage a personal trainer at the beginning to give you
                                advice and ideas that best suit you and your daily schedule. Post operative
                                exercise regime is not optional</li>
