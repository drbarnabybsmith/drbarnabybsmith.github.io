                        <h2>Choosing the right operation for you</h2>
                        <p>Once you have decided that weight loss surgery is for you, the next major step is
                            which operation is best for you. This can sometimes be straight forward but
                            commonly requires deciding between the "pros and cons" of each. For instance,
                            smoking and acid reflux would generally mean that a Gastric Sleeve and Gastric
                            Bypass respectively would be best for you.</p>

                        <p>The operation that you choose should take into account your motivating factors. If
                            comorbidity resolution (such as diabetes), solely weight loss or combination are your
                            reasons for choosing surgery then this may reflect which operation is best for you.
                            In broad terms the operations are either RESTRICTIVE (Sleeve gastrectomy),
                            MALABSORPTIVE (Duodenal switch) or combination of the two (Roux en Y and
                            Omega-loop Gastric bypass). A restrictive operation reduces the size of your
                            stomach (85%) and limits the volume you can physically eat at any one time. A
                            malabsorptive operation delays the mixing of eaten food with the enzymes required
                            for digestion to further down the gastrointestinal tract ('the gut " or small bowel) and
                            thus less calories absorbed by the body. After an operation that has a malabsorptive
                            component, one must strictly adhere to the post-operative prescribed multivitamins
                            to avoid nutritional and mineral deficiencies. Each operation has excellent weight
                            loss results however weight regains and ability to 'eat around' the surgery is higher in
                            some.</p>

                        <p>Any weight loss surgery is a major operation but generally considered safe. Major
                            complications are seen in &lt;4%. The Duodenal switch operation is not commonly
                            performed in New Zealand (&lt;1%), and if you are interested I will refer you to the
                            surgeon who performs them.</p>

                        <p>A BMI &gt;40 is equivalent to smoking in shortening one's life expectancy.</p>
