                        <h3>Cat Walden, Registered Nurse</h3>

                        <p>As a Registered Nurse with a special interest in weight loss surgery, I am here to support you throughout your surgical
                        journey. My focus is on ensuring you receive comprehensive care both before and after your procedure, with the goal of
                        providing the support needed for a successful and transformative experience.
                        What makes my approach unique is not only my professional experience but also my personal understanding of the
                        challenges involved. Having undergone weight loss surgery myself and successfully losing 40 kilograms, I am deeply
                        empathetic to the emotional and physical journey you're about to embark on. I know firsthand the triumphs and obstacles
                        that come with this life-changing decision.
                        I am available via phone and email, providing personalized care in collaboration with the multidisciplinary team (MDT),
                        which includes surgeon Barnaby Smith, psychologist, and dietitian. Together, we are dedicated to ensuring you have the
                        resources, guidance, and support you need at every stage of your weight loss journey.</p>

                        <h3>Availability</h3>
                        <p>I provide support via email and phone (call or text) once I receive a referral. I will reach out to offer personalized
                        support throughout your weight loss surgery journey. Please note that I am not available for urgent matters - contact your
                        GP, surgeon, or after-hours medical services in those cases. For non-urgent support, you can reach me anytime during
                        your care.</p>

                        <h3>Support Timeline</h3>
                        <p>I will make contact with you at key stages of your weight loss surgery journey. This includes providing guidance and
                        answering any questions you may have as you prepare for surgery and recover post-operatively. Once we have completed our
                        initial introduction phone call, I will email you a more specific support timeline.</p>

                        <h3>Post-Operative Care</h3>
                        <p>Following surgery, I will provide support and advice on various aspects of your recovery, including food and fluid
                        intake, medication, vitamin and mineral supplementation, bowel management, and wound care. I will also assist you with
                        managing your physical recovery and overall well-being. My goal is to ensure you receive the support necessary during
                        this important time.</p>

                        <p>I look forward to supporting you throughout your weight loss surgery journey, ensuring you receive the care and guidance
                        needed to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
