                        <h3>Before your Surgery</h3>

                        <h4>What is Optifast?</h4>

                        <p>Optifast is a meal replacement which is very low in calories and high in protein. It is
                            available in shakes, soups, bars, and as a dessert.</p>

                        <h4>Why do I need to take Optifast?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To reduce the size of your liver so that surgery is safer and easier.</li>
                            <li>To improve your recovery after surgery.</li>
                            <li>To kick start your weight loss.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>How do I take Optifast?</h4>

                        <p>You need to be on the Optifast diet for 2-3 weeks before your surgery as advised by your
                            dietician</p>

                        <h4>You should take:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Optifast products (as advised by dietician) per day.</li>
                            <li>Two cups of low starch vegetables per day. (see examples on the next page)</li>
                            <li>One serve of fruit per day (optional. See examples on the next page).</li>
                            <li>At least two litres of calorie-free fluids per day (see examples on the next page).</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h4>Warning</h4>
                            If you eat foods that are not permitted, it may reduce the effect of Optifast and your liver
                            may not shrink. This can make the surgery more difficult and may result in your operation
                            being cancelled.
                        </div>

                        <h4>What do I do if I have Diabetes?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                You should not need to make any changes to your diabetes management whilst you are on
                                Optifast if:
                                <ul class="mb-0">
                                    <li>Your diabetes is diet controlled or</li>

                                <li>Please contact the Diabetes team, your GP or Diabetes specialist to discuss any
                                    changes when using Optifast if:
                                    <ul class="mb-0">
                                        <li>You take any other medication such as gliclazide or insulin</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Where can I buy Optifast?</h4>

                        <p>Most pharmacies stock Optifast.</p>

                        <h4>How will I feel while taking Optifast?</h4>

                        <p>The first four days are the most difficult. Keep going - it will get easier! You may feel
                            hungry, tired and emotional. Doing more exercise may help you to get through these first few
                            days because it provides distraction and releases 'feel good' endorphins.</p>

                        <p>Constipation can be a problem for some people. To help, make sure you are eating two cups of
                            the allowed vegetables and drinking at least two litres of calorie-free fluid every day. You
                            may find drinking alpine tea, adding Benefibre to liquids, or Phloe helps. These are all
                            available in most supermarkets.</p>

                        <h3>Eating after Weight Loss Surgery</h3>

                        <h4>How it works</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weight loss surgery reduces the size of your stomach.</li>
                            <li>This restricts the size of the portions you can eat.</li>
                            <li>Your stomach size is smaller than it was.</li>
                            <li>To begin with, there will be a lot of swelling and your stomach will only hold about 30
                                ml.</li>
                            <li>During the year, this will gradually increase to about 150-200 ml.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>General recommendations:</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Eat slowly and eat until you feel full.</li>
                            <li>Chew your food well.</li>
                            <li>Allow 20 - 30 minutes to eat each meal.</li>
                            <li>Use a teaspoon, as this will help control the amount you eat.</li>
                            <li>You may only be able to eat one to two teaspoons at each meal. This will increase slowly
                                over</li>
                            <li>the next few weeks.</li>
                            <li>Avoid chewing gum, lollies and mints, even if they are sugar free.</li>
                            <li>Flavour your food. You can use all types of herbs and spices.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Protein</h4>

                        <p>
                            Having enough protein is vital for your surgery wounds to heal properly. Protein will help
                            preserve your muscle and encourage your fat stores to be used as energy.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Include two protein shakes (Optifast) per day.</li>
                            <li>Have one shake as a meal and one shake as part of your fluid.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Fluid</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Drink at least 1,500ml of calorie-free fluid per day.</li>
                            <li>Most of your fluid intake should be water.</li>
                            <li>Stop drinking 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after meals.</li>
                            <li>Sip your liquids, do not gulp as you may regurgitate or vomit.</li>
                            <li>Avoid straws as this takes in air that may bloat your small stomach.</li>
                            <li>Avoid fizzy drinks, they will make you feel bloated and can cause heartburn.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Constipation</h4>

                        <h3>Soft Diet - Start 4 weeks after surgery</h3>

                        <p>The soft diet is the transition between the puree diet and a solid diet. A soft diet includes
                            foods that are easy to eat and can be mashed with a fork. You may also be able to manage
                            some crispy foods, such as Cruskits. You should stay on a soft diet for two weeks before
                            gradually introducing more solid foods. Everyone progresses at a different rate - you may
                            need to stay on your puree or soft diet longer.</p>

                        <h4>General recommendations:</h4>

                        <ul>

                        <h2>Fluid - After surgery</h2>

                        <h3>Why is fluid important?</h3>

                        <p>After surgery you will be eating much less food, therefore you need to drink even more fluid
                            to maintain your levels of hydration. The feeling of hunger and thirst are similar and
                            sometimes you may think you are hungry, but you may in fact need a drink. Being even
                            slightly dehydrated will also decrease your energy.</p>

                        <h3>Drink Frequently</h3>

                        <p>Take small, slow, frequent sips throughout the day. You won't be able to drink fluids
                            quickly. Always have a drink bottle with you. Try and drink 500ml by lunch time, 500ml by
                            dinner and 500ml by bedtime.</p>

                        <p>Your aim after surgery is to drink at least 1.5L of calorie-free fluid per day. You may need
                            even more on hot days, or if you are exercising.</p>

                        <p>Some people mention that water doesn't taste right or it feels heavy in the stomach after
                            their surgery. If this is the case try experimenting with different temperatures of water.
                            Some people find that ice-cold, room temperature or hot water is better tolerated. Try
                            flavouring water - see overleaf for low calorie fluid ideas.</p>

                        <h4>Tea and Coffee</h4>

                        <p>It's fine to drink tea and coffee after the surgery. Try to limit the number of coffees you
                            have per day. You may have a maximum of 4 coffees per day of which only one is a milk-based
                            café coffee, or 6 cups of tea per day. Always use trim milk - trim milk also contains more
                            calcium and protein.</p>

                        <h3>Fizzy Drinks</h3>

                        <p>Drinking carbonated fluid after surgery isn't recommended. Sometimes people can't burp very
                            well and having excess gas could put pressure on your area of surgery. This may cause
                            heartburn and make you feel bloated. Over time, you should be able to manage carbonated
                            beverages if you would like them. Sparkling water is the best choice.</p>

                        <h3>Alcohol</h3>

                        <p>Alcohol is not recommended in the first six months after surgery. It is high in energy and
                            can increase appetite. Drinking alcohol can slow your weight loss and lead to weight regain.
                        </p>

                        <p>You will absorb alcohol more quickly after your surgery and reach a higher peak blood
                            alcohol. A little alcohol will have a significant effect. Please be mindful of this, if you
                            intend to drive.</p>
