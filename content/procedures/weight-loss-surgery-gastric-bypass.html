                        <h2>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass</h2>

                        <p>A Gastric Bypass is a major operation to create a small stomach pouch and rearrange the small
                            bowel to partially "bypass or delay" the food eaten from being in
                            mixed with the digestive enzymes. This results in
                            both malabsorptive and restrictive changes that results in weight loss and
                            generally improvement in various comorbidities (such as diabetes and hypertension).</p>

                        <p>A Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is a major laparoscopic operation, and requires lifestyle
                            changes to maximise its results.</p>

                        <h3>How does a Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass work?</h3>

                        <h4>Restrictive</h4>
                        <p>The majority of the stomach is disconnected forming a small pouch at the top of the
                            stomach. This measures approximately 50ml. This results in less food eaten and
                            'early satiety', which is the sensation of feeling full and satisfied after eating
                            smaller volumes and thus less calories consumed.</p>

                        <h4>Malabsorptive</h4>
                        <p>This pouch is reconnected to a segment of small bowel in a "Roux-en-Y"
                            configuration, resulting in the nutrients eaten not being in contact with the enzymes
                            required for breakdown and digestion until further down the gastrointestinal tract
                            (The "gut"). Therefore the body has less time to absorb these calories before
                            passage into the large bowel/colon</p>

                        <h4>Other changes</h4>
                        <p>Metabolic and Hormonal changes occur after the operation. These are changes in
                            the hormones and signals sent from the remaining stomach to the body. These
                            signals cause the body to secrete less hormones, that in turn 'turn down' your
                            appetite. Your body responds by controlling glucose and fats better within the blood
                            stream. Through a complex system, more Insulin is secreted and reduction in
                            'peripheral insulin resistance', which is the hallmark of Type 2 Diabetes
                            Lifestyle</p>
                        <p>Only with lifestyle changes can any Bariatric surgery be effective. These include
                            regular exercise, healthy eating, stopping smoking and avoiding high calorie foods.</p>

                                and no contraindication to surgery (liver/kidney failure, critical heart
                                disease)
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What are the benefits?</h3>

                            <li>Weight loss of between 80-85% excess body weight (sometimes
                                higher)</li>
                            <li>Diabetes (approx 70%)</li>
                            <li>High blood pressure</li>
                            <li>Obstructive sleep apnoea</li>
                            <li>Halt deterioration of weight-related conditions</li>
                            <li>40% reduction in all-cause mortality (mostly due to the improvement of
                                Diabetes, Cardiovascular risk factor and Cancer reduction)</li>
                            <li>A BMI &gt;40 is equivalent to smoking in shortening one's life expectancy
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What are the contraindications?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not psychologically prepared for lifestyle changes</li>
                            <li>Non-compliance to follow-up/ medications</li>

                            <li>Smoker</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>Preoperative care</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continued weight loss/ lifestyle changes.</li>
                            <li>Stop smoking.</li>
                            <li>Reduce Alcohol intake. Postoperatively it is recommended to avoid
                                alcohol completely for 6 months</li>
                            <li>Stabilisation/optimisation of co-morbidities (Diabetes/ High blood
                                pressure)</li>
                            <li>3 weeks before surgery you commence <strong>OPTIFAST diet</strong>, a very low-
                                calorie diet (VLCD) that is &lt;800kcal per day that completely replaces your
                                meals/ diet (Nutritionally complete)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This achieves further weight loss and deceases the size of your liver improving
                            surgical access and safer surgery with <strong>less complications</strong></p>

                        <h3>Dietician Review</h3>
                        <p>All patients will be assessed by our Dietician</p>
                        <p>This is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Optimise preoperative weight loss</li>
                            <li>Education surrounding a healthy diet</li>
                            <li>Prepare yourself for the dietary changes necessary after surgery to
                                improve weight loss and longevity of effect</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Psychologist Review</h3>
                        <p>All patients will be assessed by our psychologist. This is routine and been shown to
                            improve one's understanding around the operation and the post-operative effects on
                            your life</p>

                        <h3>Risks of surgery</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Death</strong> - &lt;1 in 600 patients</li>
                            <li><strong>Bleeding</strong> - 1% chance of blood transfusion. May require a return to
                                surgery</li>
                            <li><strong>Conversion</strong> - &lt;1% risk of a large scar</li>
                            <li><strong>Injury to bowel</strong> - &lt;1%. From the insertion of the laparoscopic
                                ports</li>
                            <li><strong>Leak</strong> - 1%. From the staple lines and anastomosis (Bowel 'joins').
                                This
                                is a serious complication. That may result in further surgery and
                                prolonged hospital stay. This is the complication that increases the risk of
                                death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vomiting/dehydration</strong> - &lt;5%. Due to small stomach volume</li>
                            <li><strong>Narrowing of the join/ anastomosis - 5% may need a stretch with a
                                    gastroscopy between week 4-8 post op</li>

                            <li><strong>Medical complications</strong> - DVT (clots), Heart attack, Skin infection,
                                Stroke, Pancreatitis</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Long term concerns</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dehydration</strong> - Due to smaller volume fluid drunk, and fluid shifts
                                in the
                                bowel.</li>
                            <li><strong>Excessive weight loss</strong> - slow sustained weight loss best.</li>
                            <li>Nutritional Deficiencies</strong> - Multi vitamins and Vit B12 injections
                                required. Calcium, Iron and Vitamin B12 are most common deficiencies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychological</strong> - Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders can
                                occur in the longer term.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gallstones</strong> - Not infrequently stones develop following Bariatric
                                surgery.
                                management is dictated by symptoms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Abdominal bloat/ vomiting</strong> - Due to various causes. Can be due to
                                "dumping" of food into the small intestine, internal scars, or angulation of
                                the sleeve. The latter may require intervention (Surgery or Endoscopic
                                dilation).</li>
                            <li><strong>"Dumping Syndrome"</strong> - A constellation of symptoms (usually
                                sweating/pain/feeling faint) following the rapid transit of food into the small
                                bowel. Due to either loss of fluid into the small bowel (Early) or low blood
                                sugar (Late). Managed by avoiding sweet foods/ dietary modification and
                                increasing fluid intake.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hernia</strong> - Through surgical scars. "Port site" hernia or "Internal
                                Hernia"
                                through small openings created during bypass</li>
