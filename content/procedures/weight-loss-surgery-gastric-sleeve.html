                    <h2>Sleeve Gastrectomy</h2>

                    <p>Sleeve gastrectomy is the removal of a large part of your stomach. This results in
                        both metabolic and restrictive changes that result in weight loss and generally
                        improvement in various comorbidities (such as Diabetes and Hypertension).</p>

                    <p>A Sleeve Gastrectomy is a major laparoscopic operation and requires lifestyle
                        changes to maximise the results for you.</p>

                    <h3>How does the Sleeve Gastrectomy work?</h3>

                    <h4>Restrictive</h4>
                    <p>The majority of the stomach is removed. Approximately 100ml 'sleeve' of the
                        stomach remains (&lt;15% of the stomach). This then results in less food being
                        consumed and with 'early satiety', this is the sensation of feeling full and satisfied
                        after eating smaller volumes and thus less calories consumed.</p>

                    <h4>Other factors</h4>
                    <p>Metabolic and hormonal changes occur after the operation. There are changes in the
                        amount of hormones and signals sent from the remaining stomach to the body, that
                        'turn down' your appetite and also creates "early satiety ". Your body also responds
                        by controlling glucose and fats better within the bloodstream (less insulin resistance-
                        which is the hallmark of type 2 Diabetes.</p>

                    <h4>Lifestyle</h4>
                    <p>Only with lifestyle changes can any Bariatric surgery be effective. These include
                        regular exercise, healthy eating, stopping smoking and avoiding high-calorie foods.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h4>Who benefits from a Sleeve Gastrectomy</h4>
                    <p>People who are committed to lifestyle changes and psychologically prepared with a; </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>BMI &gt;35</li>
                        <li>BMI &gt;30 with comorbidites (Diabetes/ Obstructive Sleep Apnoea/ Joint
                            disease)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Who has attempted several months of weight loss without desired results and no
                        contraindication to surgery (liver/kidney failure, critical heart disease
                        The benefits of weight surgery are greatest in people under 65yrs. This is due to the
                        reversibility of the comorbidities and risks of surgery. Patients with lower BMI (30-35)
                        can be discussed on a case by case basis.</p>

                    <p>Any Bariatric operation is a partnership between the Surgeon and the Patient</p>

                    <h3>What are the benefits of the Sleeve Gastrectomy?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weight loss of between 70-75% excess body weight</li>
                        <li>Resolution of comorbidities</li>
                        <li>Diabetes (approx 70-80%)</li>
                        <li>High blood pressure</li>
                        <li>Obstructive sleep apnoea</li>
                        <li>Halt deterioration of weight related conditions</li>
                        <li>A BMI &gt;40 is equivalent to smoking in shortening ones life expectancy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What are the contra-indications to a Sleeve Gastrectomy?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Moderate/Severe acid reflux ("Heartburn")</li>
                        <li>If not prepared to undergo lifestyle and dietary changes</li>
                        <li>Significant medical comorbidities (Cirrhosis of liver/ Heart failure etcâ€¦)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Preoperative cares</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continued dietary and lifestyle changes.</li>
                        <li>Strongly recommended to stop smoking and reduce alcohol intake. Post
                            operatively it is recommended to avoid alcohol completely for 6 months</li>
                        <li>Stabilisation/optimisation of co-morbidities (Diabetes/ High blood pressure)
                            2-3 weeks before surgery you commence the OPTIFAST diet, a very low-
                            calorie diet (VLCD) that is &lt;800kcal per day that completely replaces your
                            meals/ diet (Nutritionally complete).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This achieves further weight loss and decreases the size of your liver improving
                        surgical access, safer surgery and <strong>fewer complications</strong></p>

                    <h3>Dietician Review</h3>
                    <p>All patients will be assessed by our Dietician</p>
                    <p>This is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Optimise preoperative weight loss</li>
                        <li>Education surrounding a healthy diet</li>
                        <li>Prepare yourself for the dietary changes necessary after surgery</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Psychologist Review</h3>
                    <p>All patients will be assessed by our psychologist. This is routine and been shown to
                        improve one 's understanding around the operation and the post-operative effects on
                        your life.</p>

                    <h3>Risks of surgery</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Death</strong> - very low; between 1-2/1000 patients</li>
                        <li><strong>Bleeding</strong> - 1% chance of blood transfusion</li>
                        <li><strong>Leak</strong> - 1%. From staple line. <strong>This is a serious
                                complication.</strong> That may
                            result in further surgery and prolonged hospital stay.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conversion</strong> - &lt;1% risk of a large scar</li>
                        <li><strong>Injury to bowel</strong> - &lt;1%. From the insertion of the laparoscopic ports</li>
                        <li><strong>Vomiting</strong> - &lt;5%. This occasionally occurs from kinking/twisting of the
                            stomach tube. Generally resolves within 4 weeks</li>
                        <li><strong>Medical complications </strong>- DVT (clots in leg veins), Heart attacks, Skin
                            infections, Stroke, Pancreatitis - all unlikely</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Long term concerns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Increased acid reflux symptoms</strong> - Association of increased reflux
                            symptoms after Sleeve surgery (Approx 20%). Unclear cause</li>
                        <li><strong>Smaller meals</strong> - Smaller stomach volume after surgery</li>
                        <li><strong>Dehydration</strong> - Due to smaller volume fluid drunk</li>
                        <li><strong>Excessive weight loss</strong> - slow sustained weight loss best</li>
                        <li><strong>Nutritional Deficiencies</strong> - Multivitamins taken postoperatively may be
                            required. Calcium and Iron are the most common deficiencies resulting in
                            osteoporosis and anaemia respectively. These are generally mild.</li>
                        <li><strong>Psychological</strong> - Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders can occur in
                            the longer term</li>
                        <li><strong>Gallstones</strong> - Not infrequently stones develop following Sleeve surgery.
                            Management is dictated by symptoms</li>
                        <li><strong>Abdominal bloat/ vomiting</strong> - Due to various causes. Can be due to
                            "dumping " of food into the small intestine, internal scars, or angulation of the
                            sleeve. The Latter may require intervention (Surgery or Endoscopic dilation)</li>
                        <li><strong>Hernia</strong> - Through surgical scars = "Port site " hernia. Internal hernias not
                            seen
                            in Sleeve Gastrectomy </li>

                        <h3>Sleeve Gastrectomy summary</h3>

                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rapid weight loss as hunger and satiety control well tolerated. Most near
                                target weight by 1 year with maximal weight loss at 18 months</li>
                            <li>The continuity of the gastrointestinal tract is preserved so that many of the
                                nutritional complications seen with Bypasses are avoided.</li>
                            <li>Recovery time is rapid with most patients returning to work in a week or two.
                                No heavy lifting 4-6weeks</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Leaks from staple line can occur (1%), which would require hospitalisation
                                and re-intervention.</li>
                            <li>Possibly 5-10% of patients may require revisional surgery due to weight
                                regain (at 5-10+ years).</li>
