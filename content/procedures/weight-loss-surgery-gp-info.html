                        <h4>Nutritional deficiencies - What to look for post bariatric surgery</h4>
                        <h5>Protein malnutrition / protein energy malnutrition</h5>
                        <p>Protein malnutrition can occur for a number of reasons including poor dietary choice,
                            anastomotic stricture or protein malabsorption (short gut). It may present several
                            years following surgery. Protein energy malnutrition is accompanied by oedema. In
                            all cases of suspected protein malnutrition the patient must be fast tracked back the
                            Bariatric team</p>

                        <h5>Anaemia</h5>
                        Iron deficiency anaemia
                        Whilst iron deficiency anaemia is relatively common following the gastric bypass, it
                        must not be assumed that this is the only cause. Other causes should also be
                        considered and investigated if appropriate.
                        If additional oral iron does not correct the iron deficiency anaemia, parenteral iron or
                        blood transfusions may be necessary. Ensure that the patient maintains levels with
                        oral iron supplements. These should be taken with meals or drinks containing
                        vitamin C to aid absorption and at a different time to calcium supplements.
                        If the anaemia is not due to iron deficiency or blood loss, other nutritional causes
                        should be considered. These include folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper and selenium.</p>

                        <h5>Folate and vitamin B12</h5>
                        <p>Low folate levels may be an indication of noncompliance with multivitamin and
                            mineral supplements. However, it could also be an indication of severe
                            malabsorption especially if there are other nutritional deficiencies. Megaloblastic
                            anaemia is caused by folate deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12
                            deficiency, if untreated, results in irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Therefore it is
                            essential that vitamin B12 deficiency is considered before recommending additional
                            folic acid. Those patients who are vitamin B12 deficient should have levels corrected
                            with intramuscular injections of vitamin B12. Once corrected, three monthly injections
                            of 1mg vitamin B12 will maintain levels.</p>

                        <h5>Calcium, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels</h5>
                        <p>Vitamin D deficiency may result in secondary hyperparathyroidism to maintain
                            calcium levels.</p>

                        <h5>Zinc, copper and selenium</h5>
                        <p>Unexplained anaemia, poor wound healing, hair loss, neutropaenia, peripheral
                            neuropathy or cardiomyopathy may be symptoms of zinc, copper or selenium
                            deficiency and so levels should be checked if there are any concerns. Zinc and
                            copper share a common pathway so supplementation with zinc can induce copper
                            deficiency and vice versa. Information about any additional over the counter
                            supplements the patient may be taking is essential. If additional zinc
                            supplementation is required, a ratio of 1 mg copper for every 8 to 15 mg zinc must
                            be maintained.</p>

                        <h5>When to request specialist biochemical / nutritional advice or to refer your
                            patient:</h5>

                        <p>Diagnosis and management of micronutrient deficiency syndrome can be complex
                            and so when in doubt it is recommended that specialist advice is sought. The
                            following are examples of situations where this is appropriate.</p>
                        <ol>

                                investigation and treatment are uncertain.
