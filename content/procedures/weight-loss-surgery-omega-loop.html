                        <h2>The omega loop gastric bypass (mini-loop gastric bypass)</h2>

                        <p>The Omega Loop is the reduction in the size of your stomach and re-arrangement of your small
                            bowel such that the mixing of digestive enzymes/ bile (required for the breakdown of
                            calories/vitamins) with swallowed food is delayed (bypassed) to decrease absorption. This
                            results in respective restrictive and malabsorptive changes that results in weight loss and
                            generally improvement in various comorbidities (such as diabetes and hypertension).</p>

                        <p>An Omega loop Bypass is a major laparoscopic operation, and requires lifestyle changes to
                            maximise its results.</p>

                        <h2>How does an Omega Loop Gastric Bypass work?</h2>

                        <h3>Restrictive</h3>
                        <p>The majority of the stomach is removed. Approximately 100- 150ml 'sleeve' of stomach remains
                            (&lt;10% of stomach). This results in 'early satiety' , this is the sensation of feeling
                            full
                            and satisfied after eating smaller volumes and thus less calories eaten through
                            regulation of hormones ("Ghrelin").</p>

                        <h3>Malabsorptive</h3>
                        <p>This pouch is reconnected to a segment of small bowel in a "loop" configuration
                            resulting in the nutrients eaten not being in contact with the enzymes required for
                            breakdown and digestion until further down the gastrointestinal tract (The "gut")
                            than normal. Therefore the body has less time to absorb these calories before
                            passage into the large bowel/ colon</p>

                        <h3>Other Changes</h3>
                        <p>Metabolic changes occur after the operation. These are changes in the hormones and
                            signals sent from the remaining stomach to the body. These signals cause the body to
                            secrete less hormones, that in turn 'turn down' your appetite. Your body responds by
                            controlling glucose and fats better within the blood stream. Through a complex
                            system, more Insulin is secreted and reduction in 'peripheral insulin resistance',
                            which is the hallmark of Type 2 Diabetes</p>

                        <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
                        <p>Only with lifestyle changes can any Bariatric surgery be effective. These include
                            regular exercise, healthy eating, stopping smoking and avoiding high calorie foods.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Contraindications to an Omega loop Gastric Bypass</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Not psychologically prepared for lifestyle changes</li>
                            <li>Non-compliance to follow-up/ medications</li>
                            <li>Certain medical conditions</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Preoperative Cares</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continued weight loss/ lifestyle changes.</li>
                            <li>Stop smoking.</li>
                            <li>Reduce Alcohol intake. Postoperatively it is recommended to avoid alcohol
                                completely for
                                6 months.</li>
                            <li>Stabilisation/optimisation of co-morbidities (Diabetes/ High blood pressure)
                            </li>
                            <li>2-3 weeks before surgery you commence OPTIFAST diet, a very low-calorie diet
                                (VLCD) that
                                is &lt;800kcal per day that completely replaces your meals/ diet (Nutritionally
                                complete)</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p>This achieves further weight loss, and deceases the size of your liver improving
                            surgical access and safer surgery with less complications</p>

                        <p>All patients will be assessed by our
                            psychologist. This is routine and been shown to improve one's understanding around
                            the operation and the post-operative effects on your life</p>


                        <h3>Risks of surgery</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Death</strong> - &lt; 1 in 400 patients</li>
                            <li><strong>Bleeding</strong> - 3% chance of blood transfusion</li>
                            <li><strong>Conversion</strong> - &lt;2% risk of a large scar</li>
                            <li><strong>Injury to bowel</strong> - &lt;1%. From the insertion of the laparoscopic
                                ports</li>
                            <li><strong>Leak</strong> - 2%. From staple line. This is serious complication. That
                                may result
                                infurther surgery and prolonged hospital stay. A leak is the most common
                                surgical causes for death</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical complications</strong> - DVT (clots), Heart attacks, Skin
                                infections, Stroke,
                                Pancreatitis</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Long term concerns</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bile reflux symptoms</strong> - 10-20% patients experience
                                reflux symptoms due to the increased presence of bile within the stomach pouch
                                refluxing up the oesophagus</li>
                            <li><strong>Smaller meals</strong> - Smaller stomach volume after surgery</li>
                            <li><strong>Dehydration</strong> - Due to smaller volume fluid drunk</li>
                            <li><strong>Excessive weight loss</strong> - Slow sustained weight loss best</li>
                            <li><strong>Nutritional Deficiencies</strong> - Multi vitamins and Vit B12
                                injections required. Calcium, Iron and Vitamin B12 are most common deficiencies.
                                Malnutrition from vitamin deficiencies are more common then after Roux-en-Y
                                gastric
                                Bypass</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychological</strong> - Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders
                                can occur in the
                                longer term</li>
                            <li><strong>Gallstones</strong> - Not infrequently stones develop following
                                Bariatric
                                surgery. Management is dictated by symptoms</li>
                            <li><strong>Abdominal bloat/ vomiting</strong> - Due to
                                various causes. Can be due to "dumping" of food into small intestine, internal
                                scars, or angulation of the sleeve. The Latter may require intervention (Surgery
                                or
                                Endoscopic dilation)</li>
                            <li><strong>Hernia</strong> - Through surgical scars ("port site" hernia) or through
                                defects created by forming the "Bypass"</li>
                            <li><strong>Conversion to Roux en Y gastric bypass</strong> -
                                Study's have shown that 7-10% of patients have a further operation to convert an
                                Omega loop bypass to a Roux-en-Y bypass within 5 years. This is generally due to
                                reflux of bile into oesophagus ("Heartburn")</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Postoperative Cares</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hospital Stay</strong> - 2 nights</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinic review</strong> - 1-week post-op, 4 weeks post-op, 3 months
                                post-op</li>
                            <li><strong>Diet</strong> - Optifast for 3 weeks, Soft diet from weeks 3-6 weeks,
                                Lite diet from 6
                                weeks</li>
