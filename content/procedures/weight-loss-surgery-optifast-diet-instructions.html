                        <h2>Optifast Diet Instructions</h2>

                        <p>
                            You will have told you how long you need to follow this diet before surgery. This depends on
                            your personal treatment plan.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How do I take Optifast?</h3>
                        <p>Make sure you have 4 Optifast packets each day. Do not drink less than 4 Optifast a day as
                            this can result in muscle loss and poor healing after surgery. Mix 1 packet with at least
                            300 ml (11‚ÅÑ4 cups) of cold water. You can add ice cubes if you like. Shake well or blend in
                            a blender. Drink at least 2 litres (8 cups) of fluid each day including the Optifast
                            amounts.</p>

                        <h3>Optifast Diet Instructions</h3>

                        <h4>Can I add anything to change the flavour?</h4>

                        <ul>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>What do I do if I have diabetes?</h4>
                        <p>If may need help adjusting your diabetes medications while on Optifast</p>

                        <h4>What if I have constipation or diarrhoea while taking Optifast?</h4>

                        <p>Sometimes, people have constipation or diarrhoea while taking Optifast. This is mostly
                            related to the low amount of fibre found in the product.</p>

                        <p>If you have constipation, try increasing your liquids up to 3 litres (12 cups) each day. You
                            can also try using a fibre supplement such as Benefibre or Metamucil capsules. Use the
                            sugar-free versions of these products. Start with the lowest dose and follow the
                            instructions on the label, up to the maximum daily dose. If you still have constipation, you
                            can also use medications for constipation such as Colace, Senekot or milk of magnesia.</p>

                        <p>
                            If you have diarrhoea, it is still important to drink at least 2 litres (8 cups) of fluids
                            daily. Using a fibre supplement such as Benefibre or Metamucil capsules can also help with
                            diarrhoea. Use the sugar-free versions of these products. Start with the lowest dose and
                            follow the instructions on the label, up to the maximum daily
                            dose.
