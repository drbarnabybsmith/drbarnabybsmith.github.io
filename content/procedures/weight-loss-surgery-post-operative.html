                        <h2>Postoperative vitamin and element replacement</h2>

                        <p>After a Gastric Bypass you are more likely to develop vitamin and elemental deficiencies. The
                            duodenum and first part of the small bowel is on longer in contact with your ingested food.
                            It is here that some vitamins and elements are absorbed into the blood stream. This is
                            generally less following a Sleeve Gastrectomy, as there is no mal-absorptive component (the
                            gut continuity is 'normal'). </p>

                        <p>Common deficiencies are calcium (if low can thin bones), iron (if low results in anaemia) and
                            vitamin B12 (if low can result in abnormal red blood cells). To account for this you will be
                            required to take regular daily chewable multi-vitamin tablets and Vitamin D supplementation.
                            Vitamin B12 will require a 6-12monthly injection at your GP. This will generally be adequate
                            however we recommend annual blood test. A bone density scan is recommended at 2 and 5 years
                            to assess any premature thinning of your bones.</p>

                        <p>Common examples of chewable multivitamin tablets are;</p>

                        </ul>

                        <p>It is important that these multivitamins and injections are continued lifelong.</p>
