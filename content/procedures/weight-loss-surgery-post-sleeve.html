                            <h3>Week 1: Liquids</h3>
                            <p>For the first day after surgery, you'll only be allowed to drink clear liquids.</p>
                            <p>Once you're handling clear liquids, you can start having other liquids, such as</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Optifast (or similar)</li>
                                <li>Broth</li>

                                <li>Milk (skim)</li>
                                <li>Sugar-free gelatin or popsicles</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Aim for 1.5 - 2.0 litres per day</p>
                            <p>All drinks should be low in sugar</p>

                            <h3>Day 5: Pureed foods</h3>

                            <p>After 5 days of tolerating liquids, you can begin to eat strained and pureed (mashed
                                up) foods. The foods should have the consistency of a smooth paste, pudding or a
                                thick liquid, without any solid pieces of food in the mixture. V-8 juice and
                                first-stage
                                baby foods, which do not contain solids, are also convenient options.
                                As you start to include purees into your diet, it's important not to drink fluids
                                while
                                you eat.</p>
                            <p>You can eat three to six small meals a day. Each meal should consist of 4 to 6
                                tablespoons of food.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Eat slowly — about 30 minutes for each meal
                                    Choose foods that will puree well, such as:</li>
                                <li>Lean ground meat, poultry or fish, cottage cheese, soft scrambled eggs ,
                                    yogurt, white fish, cottage cheese, ricotta, cooked cereal, soft fruits and
                                    cooked vegetables (applesauce, bananas, canned fruits, peaches, apricots,
                                    pears, pineapples, melons), strained cream soups
                                    Blend solid foods with a liquid, such as:</li>
                                <li>Water, Skim milk, Juice with no sugar added, Broth
                                    Practical tips to help meet Nutritional Requirements at Pureed Stage:</li>
                                <li>Each meal should include a high protein food item</li>
                                <li>Protein shakes should be included to help ensure an adequate protein intake
                                    and protein powder can be added to meals to increase the protein content
                                    Spicy seasonings may irritate the stomach, so avoid these completely or try them
                                    one at a time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Avoid fruits that have lots of seeds, such as strawberries or kiwifruit. You should
                                also
                                stay away from foods that are too fibrous to liquefy, such as broccoli and
                                cauliflower.</p>

                            <h3>Weeks 3-5: Soft foods</h3>
                            <p>After a few weeks of pureed foods you can start soft diet (generally week 4). They
                                should be small, tender and easily chewed pieces of food.</p>

                            <p>You can eat three to five small meals a day. Each meal should consist of one-third
                                to
                                one-half cup of food. Chew each bite until the food is pureed consistency before
                                swallowing.</p>

                            <h4>Soft foods include:</h4>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Include 1 protein shake per day as part of fluid intake</p>

                                <h3>&gt;6 Weeks: Solid foods</h3>
                                <p>After about 6 weeks on the gastric bypass diet, you can gradually return to eating
                                    firmer foods. Start with eating three meals a day, with each meal consisting of 1 to
                                    1-1/2 cups of food. It's important to stop eating before you feel completely full.
                                    Depending on how you tolerate solid food, you may be able to vary the number of
                                    meals and amount of food at each meal. Talk to your dietitian about what's best for
                                    you.</p>

                                <p>Try new foods one at a time. Certain foods may cause pain, nausea or vomiting after
                                    gastric bypass surgery.</p>

                                <p>Foods that can cause problems at this stage include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Breads, carbonated drinks, raw vegetables, cooked fibrous vegetables, such
                                        as celery, broccoli, corn or cabbage, tough meats or meats with gristle, red
                                        meat, fried foods, highly seasoned or spicy foods, nuts and seeds and
                                        popcorn</li>
