                    <h2>How does weight loss surgery work?</h2>

                    <p>The Gastrointestinal tract (gut) is a complex system of hormones, enzymes and feedback-systems
                        that
                        control
                        the absorption of food, the bodies response to and desire for more food (Satiety). Surgery
                        alters
                        the
                        gut to
                        achieve both weight loss and better metabolic control of the absorbed calories / glucose. This is
                        achieved
                        by
                        RESTRICTIVE, MALABSORPTIVE (or a COMBINATION OF RESTRICTIVE/MALABSORPTIVE) types of surgery.</p>

                    <p>Most absorption of food (Calories, elements and vitamins) occurs in the small bowel. The large
                        bowel
                        is
                        almost mostly solely for fluid absorption. Various parts of the small bowel are more designed to
                        absorb
                        different parts of your diet (i.e. Calcium in Duodenum, vitamin K in Terminal ileum) and secrete
                        a
                        number of
                        hormones to control digestion and feed-back to the brain.</p>

                    <h3>Restrictive</h3>
                    <p>The Stomach is a reservoir that can hold over 1000ml, this enables us to comfortably have large
                        meals
                        (i.e.
                        three square meals a day). Weight loss surgery creates a smaller gastric 'pouch' or 'sleeve'.
                        This
                        is
                        typically 50-100ml in volume and significantly decreases the volume one can consume at once.
                        When
                        this
                        new
                        stomach is filled up at low volumes, it signals through nerves and hormones to the brain to stop
                        eating
                        and
                        the body and brain feel satisfied and “full”. Patients do not desire to eat more (Satiety) due
                        to
                        the
                        brains
                        response to Ghrelin. Ghrelin is known as the “hunger hormone”.</p>

                    <h3>Malabsorptive</h3>
                    <p>Weight loss surgery re-arranges the internal plumbing of the small bowel to delay the
                        mixing of
                        eaten
                        food
                        with the bile and enzymes required for its digestion. This delay in mixing means that
                        there is
                        less
                        time
                        in
                        the small bowel for this digestion to occur and less calories absorbed. Typically this
                        mixing is
                        delayed
                        by
                        100-150cm (the typical small bowel length ranges from 300cm - 600cm).

                    <h3>Metabolic and other changes</h3>
                    <p>Weight loss surgery causes alteration in various hormones that result in the body
                        behaving
                        differently to
                        ingested food / calories. This is not completely understood, but the most commonly
                        described
                        immediate
                        change
                        is the loss of peripheral insulin resistance seen in type 2 Diabetics. Within days of
                        surgery a
                        large
                        number
                        of Diabetic patients have better control of their blood sugar levels as a result of the
                        body
                        responding
                        to
                        insulin more effectively and lowering blood sugar levels. Other metabolic benefits seen
                        are
                        improved
                        blood
                        pressure and lipid profile through complex feed-back loops.</p>
